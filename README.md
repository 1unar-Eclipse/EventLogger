# EventLogger
Logs every Latite plugin event in detail!

This is primarily intended for plugin developers to figure out cues they can use in events. Do not use this as chat archival; there are a bunch of weird symbols stored due to basegame logic.

To-do:
 - Ability to split events by file (suggested by Plextora)

This plugin was made using the plugin template found [here](https://github.com/LatiteScripting/Template).
