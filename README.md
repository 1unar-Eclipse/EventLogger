# EventLogger
Logs every Latite plugin event in detail!

This is primarily intended for plugin developers to figure out cues from events. Do not use this as chat archival; there are a bunch of weird symbols stored due to basegame logic.

To-do:
 - Format timestamps by user's timezone
 - Ability to split events by file
